# KOKO HOOKS

I am just trying to solidify my understanding of react and the web by exploring and studying __custom react hooks__ as [usehooks](https://usehooks.com/) and [usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com/) websites.

The ultimate goal is gain the technical acumen to write highly performant react code for the web.
